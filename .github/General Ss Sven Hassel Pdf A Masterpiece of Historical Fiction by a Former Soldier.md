SS General is one of the most popular novels by Sven Hassel, who claimed to have based his stories on his own experiences as a soldier in a penal battalion. However, his authenticity has been disputed by some historians and critics, who argue that he exaggerated or fabricated many details. Regardless of its historical accuracy, SS General is a gripping and entertaining read that offers a different perspective on World War II from the point of view of the German soldiers[^2^] [^1^].

Some of the memorable scenes in SS General include the attack on a Russian tank column, the escape from a POW camp, the encounter with a group of cannibalistic Cossacks, and the final stand at Stalingrad. The novel also explores the relationships between the soldiers, who are loyal to each other despite their differences and backgrounds. They often clash with their superiors, who are portrayed as cruel, incompetent and corrupt.
 
SS General is part of a series of 14 novels by Sven Hassel, which are loosely connected by the same characters and settings. The first novel in the series is The Legion of the Damned, which introduces the penal battalion and its members. The last novel in the series is The Commissar, which follows the fate of the survivors after the war. The novels can be read in any order, as they are not chronological and often contradict each other.
 
SS General is a novel that will appeal to fans of war fiction, especially those who are interested in the Eastern Front and the German perspective. It is a fast-paced and action-packed story that does not shy away from depicting the brutality and absurdity of war. It is also a novel that raises questions about morality, loyalty and survival in a time of chaos and violence.
